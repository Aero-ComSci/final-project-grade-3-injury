# Stuff we did:
 - Learn how PYGAME works?
 - Figure out what we want to make for the final project?

# Project Description
- This program is essentially made for anyone who has a passion in games not just video games but all sorts of games, specifically survival games. However, we say essentially as this game is not catered to any ONE audience and instead peaks and reveals itself to a plethora of people who have any interest in what this game provides as it forces people to learn through challenges that involve critical thinking and push the human brain to the edge due to the infinite amount of possibilities for how the survival on the island could turn out.

- What this program does it automate and create an environement where the user is forced to make decisions based on their own choices, and due to this will either end up avoiding death on the island. But, on the other hand the user could also make terrible decisions leading to their ultimate demise.
